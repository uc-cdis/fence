# Usersync

Usersync is a script that parses user access information from multiple sources (user.yaml files, dbGaP user authorization "telemetry" files AKA whitelists) and keeps users' access to Gen3 resources up to date by updating the Fence and Arborist databases.



## Usersync flow

![Usersync Flow](images/usersync.png)

> The access from the user.yaml file and the dbGaP authorization files is combined (see example below), but the user.yaml file overrides the user information (such as email) obtained from the dbGaP authorization files.

## Configuration

Configuration for user sync lives in fence-config.yaml for each respective environment. An example of the fence-config can be found [fence/config-default.yaml](https://github.com/uc-cdis/fence/blob/master/fence/config-default.yaml).

You can configure one or more dbGaP SFTP servers to sync telemetry files from. To configure one single dbGaP server, add credentials and information to the fence-config.yaml under `dbGaP`, this is outlined in [here](https://github.com/uc-cdis/fence/blob/4.14.0/fence/config-default.yaml#L389-L433)

To configure additional dbGaP servers, include in the config.yaml a list of dbGaP servers under `dbGaP`, like so:

```
dbGaP:
- info:
    host:
    username:
    password:
    ...
  protocol: 'sftp'
  ...
  ...
- info:
    host:
    username:
    ...
```

An example can be found in the config used for unit testing [tests/test-fence-config.yaml](https://github.com/uc-cdis/fence/blob/master/tests/test-fence-config.yaml)

### Enable dbGaP backup to s3:
Add below to manifest.json to global block to copy dbGaP authorization files to <dbgap_backup_bucket>:
```
+    "dbgap_backup_bucket": "s3://di-planx-test",
+    "aws_sa_rule_arn": "arn:aws:iam::707767160287:role/devplanetv1-dbgap-bakup-role",
```
More deployment details can be found here: https://github.com/uc-cdis/cdis-wiki/blob/master/ops/DBGAP-backup-deployment.md

### Example of dbGaP authorization file (CSV format):

```
user name, login, authority, role, email, phone, status, phsid, permission set, created
Mr. DEF,DEF,eRA,PI,def@com,"123-456-789",active,phs3.v2.p3.c4,"General Research Use",2013-03-19 12:32:12.600
Mrs. GHI,GHI,eRA,PI,ghi@com,"123-456-789",active,phs3.v2.p3.c4,"General Research Use",2013-03-19 12:32:12.600
```

Usersync gives users "read" and "read-storage" permissions to the dbGaP studies.

> Note: The dbGaP authorization files contain consent codes that can be parsed by usersync: [more details here](dbgap_info.md). This simplified example does not include consent code parsing.

### Resulting access:

- user ABC:
  - /open: read + read-storage
  - /programs/myprogram: read, read-storage, write-storage
  - /programs/phs1: read + all methods on indexd
  - /programs/phs2: read
- user DEF:
  - /open: read + read-storage
  - /programs/phs1: read
  - /programs/phs2: read
  - /programs/phs3: read + read-storage _(from the dbGaP authorization file)_
- user GHI:
  - /programs/phs3: read + read-storage + create _(user.yaml access combined with dbGaP authorization file access)_

## Validation

The [gen3users CLI](https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3users) includes a user.yaml validation tool:
```
pip install gen3users
gen3users validate user.yaml
```
