"""
Test specifically the behavior of using a refresh token at the token endpoint.

OIDC spec for successful refresh response:

    If an ID Token is returned as a result of a token refresh request, the
    following requirements apply:
    - its iss Claim Value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued when the
      original authentication occurred,
    - its sub Claim Value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued when the
      original authentication occurred,
    - its iat Claim MUST represent the time that the new ID Token is issued,
    - its aud Claim Value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued when the
      original authentication occurred,
    - if the ID Token contains an auth_time Claim, its value MUST represent the
      time of the original authentication - not the time that the new ID token
      is issued,
    - its azp Claim Value MUST be the same as in the ID Token issued when the
      original authentication occurred; if no azp Claim was present in the
      original ID Token, one MUST NOT be present in the new ID Token, and
    - otherwise, the same rules apply as apply when issuing an ID Token at the
      time of the original authentication.
