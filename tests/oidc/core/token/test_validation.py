"""
Test the OP validation of the token request.

Spec from OIDC 3.1.3.2:

    The Authorization Server MUST validate the Token Request as follows:

    - Authenticate the Client if it was issued Client Credentials or if it uses
      another Client Authentication method, per Section 9.
    - Ensure the Authorization Code was issued to the authenticated Client.
    - Verify that the Authorization Code is valid.
    - If possible, verify that the Authorization Code has not been previously
      used.
    - Ensure that the redirect_uri parameter value is identical to the
      redirect_uri parameter value that was included in the initial
      Authorization Request. If the redirect_uri parameter value is not present
      when there is only one registered redirect_uri value, the Authorization
      Server MAY return an error (since the Client should have included the
      parameter) or MAY proceed without an error (since OAuth 2.0 permits the
      parameter to be omitted in this case).
    - Verify that the Authorization Code used was issued in response to an
      OpenID Connect Authentication Request (so that an ID Token will be
      returned from the Token Endpoint).

Tests for client authentication are in
``tests/oidc/core/token/test_client_authentication.py``.

The rest of these points have tests below.
