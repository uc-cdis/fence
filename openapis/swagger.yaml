        Try to update a Google Cloud Project's service account to change access to
        controlled data and/or extend access to data WITHOUT actually doing so.
        This would extend the service account's access to data if using the non _dry_run
        endpoint. It would also modify access if a patch document is provided with new access.

        > *NOTE*: If you do not provide a patch document (e.g. no payload),
        this will extend access to ALL PREVIOUS DATA. If you want to REMOVE
        access, either use the DELETE endpoint or provide a patch document
        with an empty list for "project_access". It's important to note that
        providing {"project_access": []} is different than not including a
        payload at all.

        > **WARNING**: Provided patch document will *fully replace* previous data.
        It will NOT extend previous data by provided values, it will FULLY
        REPLACE the data with what's provided.
