# Fence

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uc-cdis/fence.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uc-cdis/fence)

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/uc-cdis/fence/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/uc-cdis/fence?branch=master)

A `fence` separates protected resources from the outside world and allows
only trusted entities to enter.

Fence is a core service of the Gen3 stack that has multiple capabilities:

1. Act as an [auth broker](docs/additional_documentation/terminology.md#auth-broker) to integrate with one
or more [IdPs](docs/additional_documentation/terminology.md#idp) and provide downstream authentication
and authorization for Gen3 services.
2. [Manage tokens](docs/additional_documentation/token_management.md).
3. Act as an [OIDC provider](README.md#oidc--oauth2) to support external
applications to use Gen3 services.
4. [Issue short-lived, cloud native credentials to access data in various cloud storage services](docs/additional_documentation/data_access.md#accessing-data)


## Overview

### Identity Providers


Fence can be configured to support different Identity Providers (IdPs) for AuthN.
At the moment, supported IDPs include:

- Google
- [Shibboleth](docs/additional_documentation/fence_shibboleth.md)
  - NIH iTrust
  - InCommon
  - eduGAIN
- CILogon
- Cognito
- Synapse
- Microsoft
- ORCID
- RAS

### API Documentation

[OpenAPI documentation available here.](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uc-cdis/fence/master/openapis/swagger.yaml)

YAML file for the OpenAPI documentation is found in the `openapis` folder (in
the root directory); see the README in that folder for more details.


## OIDC & OAuth2

Fence acts as a central broker that supports multiple IdPs.
At the same time, it acts as an IdP itself.
In that sense, `fence` is both an `RP` and an `OP`.

### Fence as RP

Example:

- Google IAM is the OpenID Provider (OP)
- Fence is the Relying Party (RP)
- Google Calendar API is the resource provider

### Fence as OP

- Fence is the OpenID Provider (OP)
- A third-party application is the Relying Party (RP)
- Gen3 microservices (e.g. [`sheepdog`](https://github.com/uc-cdis/sheepdog)) are resource providers

### Example Flows

Note that the `3rd Party App` acts as the `RP` in these examples.

[//]: # (See /docs folder for README on how to regenerate these sequence diagrams)

#### Flow: Client Registration

![Client Registration](./docs/images/seq_diagrams/client_registration.png)

#### Flow: OpenID Connect

In the following flow, Fence and the IdP together constitute an `OP`.
Fence, by itself, acts as an OAuth 2.0 Auth Server; the IdP enables the additional implementation of OIDC (by providing AuthN). From an OIDC viewpoint, therefore, Fence and the IdP can be abstracted into one `OP`.

![OIDC Flow](./docs/images/seq_diagrams/openid_connect_flow.png)

If the third-party application doesn't need to use any Gen3 resources (and just
wants to authenticate the user), they can just get
needed information in the `ID token` after the handshake is finished .

#### Flow: Using Tokens for Access

If a third-party application wants to use Gen3 resources like
`fence`/`sheepdog`/`peregrine`, they call those services with an `Access Token`
passed in an `Authorization` header.

In the following flow, `3rd Party App` is the `RP`; `Protected Endpoint` is an endpoint of a Gen3 Resource (the `microservice`), and both of these are part of a `resource server`; and `Fence` is the `OP`. Here, importantly, `Fence` may be interfacing with another IdP _or_ with another `Fence` instance in order to implement the OIDC layer. Either way, note that the `Fence` blob in this diagram actually abstracts Fence in concert with some IdP, which may or may not also be (a different instance of) Fence.

#### Flow: Refresh Token Use

![Using Refresh Token](./docs/images/seq_diagrams/refresh_token_use.png)

#### Flow: Refresh Token Use (Token is Expired)

![Using Expired Refresh Token](./docs/images/seq_diagrams/refresh_token_use_expired.png)

#### Flow: Multi-Tenant Fence

The following diagram illustrates the case in which one fence instance
uses another fence instance as its identity provider.

A use case for this is when we set up a fence instance that uses NIH login as the IdP. Here, we go through a detailed approval process in NIH. Therefore, we would like to do it only once for a single lead Fence instance, and then allow other fence instances to simply redirect to use the lead Fence as an IdP for logging in via NIH.

In the following flow, `Fence (Client Instance)` is an OP relative to `OAuth Client`, but an RP relative to `Fence (IDP)`.

#### Notes

See the [OIDC specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) for more details.
Additionally, see the [OAuth2 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).


### Google Cloud Storage

Whereas pre-signed URL is a cloud-agnostic solution, services and tools on Google Cloud Platform prefer to use Google's concept of a "Service Account". Because of that, Fence provides a few more methods to access data in Google.

See [Fence and Google](docs/additional_documentation/google_architecture.md) for more details on data access methods specific to Google.
