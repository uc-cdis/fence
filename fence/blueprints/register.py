    - Users may access this endpoint directly.
    - At the moment, registration involves providing firstname, lastname, org, and
      (if user.email for the user is None) email.
    - If a user registers, add the new information to the user's additional_info column,

      the permissions are defined by the group definition in the useryaml).

    it is a separate blob in order to avoid namespace collision and make clear that the
    information was self-declared by the user during registration.

    Some basic validation is done on form inputs (non-empty fields, plausible emails),
    but actual verification (for example, checking organization info against some trusted
    authority's records) has been deemed out of scope.
